### Introduction

Over the last 20 years from relative obscurity to being all pervasive the internet has changed the course of human interactions with the world. Being connected to the internet is an important pre-requisite for all humans in order to conduct their day to day lives be it financial, health, social and communication. The ability to book tickets without going to the theatre or the ability to send money from one person to the other without going to a bank or the ability to keep in touch with friends or being able to buy products without visiting a store also means that bad people might be looking for an opportunity to steal information such as credit cards, health records, personal information thereby causing a loss to the individual. As developers of web applications, it is important that we are aware of the different kinds of attacks on a web application and how to prevent them.

### Security Breaches

#### Facebook

In September of 2018, Facebook disclosed that between 30-90 million user access tokens were stolen which gave the hackers access to the users' Facebook accounts and their data that was held because of a bug in web apps **view as** feature.

#### Panera Bread

Panera Bread is a chain of bakery cafe's in the USA and between August 2017 - April 2018, upto **37 million** customers' personal information was stolen. The names, contact details and partial payment details were freely available in plain text. If the correct URL was used, anyone would be able to access Panera Bread’s customers’ data

#### Canva Data Breach

In May 2019, Canva a graphic-design tool website suffered a data breach that resulted in the loss of 139 million users' personal data. This included customer usernames, real names, email addresses, password and city and country information.

For some more data breaches in 2019, I would recommend you read \[this\]([https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91366-the-top-12-data-breaches-of-2019](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91366-the-top-12-data-breaches-of-2019 "https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91366-the-top-12-data-breaches-of-2019") 'Top 12 Security Breaches in 2019').

In all of the above incidents, user information was stolen leading to disclosure of personally identifiable information or financial information and highlights the need for the developers to build secure web applications. In orders to build secure web applications, it is important to understand the different types of threats or vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

The impact of a data or security breach can range from outage (having short term revenue impact), loss of trust (leading to long term revenue impact), lawsuits against the company, government actions against the company (in case of compliance violations) and so on.
